## 📁 Project Structure

```text
main.py            # FastAPI application and routing
dashboard.py       # Streamlit-based user interface
services/          # Core logic for OCR, translation, and RAG
requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
.gitignore         # Prevents sensitive/local files from being pushed
```

---

## 🔐 .gitignore

Create a file named `.gitignore` in your root folder and paste the following:

```text
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Environments
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/
env.bak/
venv.bak/

# Project specific
.vscode/
.idea/
*.log

# Distribution / packaging
dist/
build/
*.egg-info/

# AWS/Secrets
.aws/
credentials
secrets.json
```

This ensures:
- Virtual environments are not pushed  
- Local configuration files remain private  
- AWS credentials and secrets stay secure
